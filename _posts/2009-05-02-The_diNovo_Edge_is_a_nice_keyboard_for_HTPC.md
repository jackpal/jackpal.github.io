title: The diNovo Edge is a nice keyboard for HTPC
---

I just bought a [Logitech diNovo Edge Mac Edition](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard/devices/4741&cl=us,en)
keyboard for my Mac Mini HTPC. I bought the diNovo instead of the Apple
Bluetooth keyboard because:

1. Built-in trackpad.
2. Built in volume control slider.
3. Dedicated media transport controls.
4. Nifty dock / recharger stand.

It's my first Bluetooth device. So far I think Bluetooth works a lot better
than IR, because you don't have to point it at an IR receiver.

The diNovo does have some flaws:

* No key backlighting, which makes it hard to use in the dark.
* The mouse buttons below the trackpad are mushy and hinged at the outer edges, making them hard to press. (Happily tapping works and there is a separete left-mouse-button on the left edge of the keyboard. So for typical Mac usage you don't need to use the mushy buttons.)
* A skim of the Logitech support forums indicates that the function keys are not as programmable as some people wish. I don't use function keys that much so this hasn't been an issue for me yet.

My TV is a 40" LCD, and I sit about 15 feet away from it. At this distance the
1920 x 1280 desktop is just too high resolution for my eyes, so I reduced my
screen resolution to 1366 x 720. That seems to work well for now. Apparently I
need to get a bigger TV :-)

Using a keyboard/trackpad instead of a button-
based remote control is nice. I like being able to use all the ordinary apps
that I already know how to use, rather than have to learn a new set of apps
and UI commands. I also like not having to switch input devices depending upon
what I'm trying to do. (For example if I want to use a web browser to look up
some fact about a video that I just watched, it just works.)

The diNovo is
very smartly designed, so that it's easy to use the mouse while holding the
keyboard in two hands. Of course I'm a right hander. A left hander might have
a different opinion, as the trackpad is located where it can be used easily
with the right hand, but not the left hand.

### What about Linux?

I have been able
to use the same keyboard with both Mac and Kubuntu 9.04. With Kubuntu there
were some issues around the initial pairing: You need a working keyboard and
mouse in order to pair a new Bluetooth device. You even need to reboot once,
and answer one final dialog box using a working keyboard / mouse, before the
new device pairing is complete.

A second issue for HTPC use is that the Mac
Mini video driver on Kubuntu does not have the flexability to slightly lower
the resolution of the screen. I blame Intel for this, as they are in the
middle of converting to a new driver model and their current drivers are
pretty bare bones.

One final issue for dual booting Mac systems is that it
seems to take a while for the keyboard to reconnect after a restart. This is
an issue if you have reFit installed and you're trying to send keystrokes to
reFit during the reboot. I found I had to press multiple keys multiple times
until reFit started recognizing keys, after which the keyboard acted normally.
