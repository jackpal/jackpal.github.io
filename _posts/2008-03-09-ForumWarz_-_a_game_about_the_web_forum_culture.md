title: ForumWarz - a game about the web forum culture
---

This is an interesting role-playing-game set in current-day web forum culture:

[http://www.forumwarz.com/](http://www.forumwarz.com/)

It's somewhat not-safe-for-work, and the humor is
pretty low-brow. But what's neat is that you play it through your browser, and
it recreates the look-and-feel of web forum culture perfectly. It wouldn't
surprise me if the authors just captured the HTML for various real-world
forums to create the resources for the game. (Or alternately, created their
own fictional forums using web tools, and then captured the HTML from those
fictional forums.)

The actual game didn't hold my interest for very long, but
it's free and it's fun for a few days.
