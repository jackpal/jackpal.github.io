This morning I fired up Mario Galaxy 64 on my new Wii for some early-morning
platforming. I happened to sit closer to the screen than I normally do. Yuck!
The jaggies were suddenly very apparent and very distracting. But when I moved
back to my normal viewing distance, the jaggies were gone, blurred out by my
poor vision.

It's no wonder that HDTV and HD gaming in general is not taking
off as quickly as consumer electronics companies hoped -- the benefits are
just not that apparent to normal eyes at normal viewing distance.

Jaggies aside, Mario Galaxy 64 is great fun! A very smooth difficulty curve, and
gorgeous graphics. Right now I'm working my way through the candy level. (I
have seven stars.)
