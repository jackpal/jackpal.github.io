# 3dMark price/performance charts

3DMark is a GPU/CPU benchmark used by PC gamers to measure system performance.
Here are some great charts showing

* [What GPU/CPU/RAM/OS/Screen size gamers have, and how it's changed over time](http://www.yougamers.com/hardware/stats/3dmark06/alltime/)

* [The best bang-per-buck for GPUs and CPUs](http://www.yougamers.com/hardware/stats/3dmark06/priceandperformance/)

My home computer system is very weak compared to these charts, except in one
dimension, which is that my 1600 x 1200 display puts me in the top 10% of
gamers. Woot!

While many people (myself included) have switched to laptops
and/or all-in-ones, if you're planning on building a new desktop, check out
the [Ars Technica system guide](http://arstechnica.com/guides/buyer/guide-200801.ars). The guide
does a good job of speccing out a "Budget Box", a "Hot Rod", and a "God Box",
and it's updated every quarter.
