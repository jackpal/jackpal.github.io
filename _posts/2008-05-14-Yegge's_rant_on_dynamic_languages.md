title: Yegge's rant on dynamic languages

Another superb rant by Steve Yegge on dynamic languages:

The comment section's good too -- especially the long comment by Dan Weinreb
of Lisp / ITA software fame. Steve's got the same problem some of my
self-taught friends do (hi Bob, hi Jim!): he'll say something in a strongly
opinionated way, without
giving supporting evidence. I think that makes people think he doesn't know
what he's talking about. So people tend to write him off. But if you talk with
him, it almost always turns out his strong opinions are backed by some pretty
deep experience and insight. I've learned to give Steve (and my self-taught
friends) the benefit of the doubt.
