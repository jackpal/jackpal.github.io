title: Pro No Mo - I don't really need a MacBook Pro machine for hobby programming.
---

I've been trying to decide which Apple laptop to buy for hobby programming.

I'm leaning towards the cheapest laptop Apple sells, the 2019 MacBook Air. As
far as I can tell, is fine for my current needs.

I specced out a more powerful and future-proof laptop, a 2019 MacBook Pro with
2x the RAM and SSD storage, but it was 60% more expensive.

I think it makes more sense for me to buy the cheaper laptop today, and plan
on replacing it sooner. Especially because I have a lot of family members who
would be fine with the cheaper laptop as a hand-me-down.

It does feel a little weird to decide that I don't need a "Pro" machine. When
it comes down to it, Xcode, a SSD and a retina display are all the "Pro" I
need for hobby programming, and Apple has made those features available in the
budget Air line.

## Follow-up

In the end I bought the more expensive Macbook Pro. I am a sucker. :-)
