# Wow, TVs are complicated

Check out this
[teardown of a Sony OLED TV](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=243).
It looks like Sony has a
standardized architecture for their TVs, which makes sense, but which also
means that some TVs have unused capabilities (such as a multi-core CPU
powerful enough to run a web browser. I wish an enterprising hacker would
figure out how to download code and run them on the TVs -- my understanding
from reading Sony's GPL web site is that they already have Linux and busybox
installed. Oh well, maybe GPL 3.0 will force Sony to make their TVs user-
upgradable in the future.

It's significant that Sony's not using the Cell CPU
in their TVs. That was part of the justification for spending so much on Cell.
I assume this means that Cell's just not cost-effective for TVs.
