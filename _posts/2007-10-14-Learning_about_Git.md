# Learning about Git

Lately I've been learning the git source code control system. It's a
distributed version control system, which means there is no central
repository. It's especially good for working on multiple branches.

Alas, currently git doesn't work well on Windows. (Due to many of its utilities being written in a hodge-podge of Unix shell scripts. Pretty lame. If they'd
just used C, Perl, or Python it would have been very easy to port.)
