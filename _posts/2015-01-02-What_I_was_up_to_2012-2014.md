# What I was up to 2012-2014

It's been a while since my last post -- I've been posting inside the Google
internal ecosystem, but haven't posted much publicly.

What have I been up to in the past 3 years?

**Work**

Prototyped a [Dart runtime for Android](https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Android). Amusingly enough, this
involved almost no Dart code. It was 90% Python coding (wrangling Gyp build system scripts) and 10% C++ coding
(calling the Dart VM).

Extended the Audio players for [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/store/music)'s Web client. I learned
ActionScript, the Closure dialect of JavaScript, and HTML5 Audio APIs (Web Audio and EME.)

Started working on the [Google Play Music iOS client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-music/id691797987?mt=8).
I learned Objective C, Swift, iOS and Sqlite.

**Personal Projects**

Prototyped a Go language runtime for Android. Unpublished, but luckily the
[Go team is picking up the slack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N3XyVkAP8nmWjASz8L_OjjnjVKxgeVBjIsTr5qIUcA4/edit).

Finished working on [Terminal Emulator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm).
I'm keeping it on life support, but no new features.

**Personal Life**

Started exercising again after a 10 year hiatus. It's good to get back into shape.

Switched to a low cholesterol diet. Google's cafes make this pretty easy to do.

Watched my kids grow!
