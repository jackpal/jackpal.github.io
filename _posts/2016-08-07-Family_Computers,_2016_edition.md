# Family Computers, 2016 edition

As the summer of 2016 draws to an end, it's time to plan my family's IT setup
for the 2016-2017 school year.

##  My current setup

* iPhones
* Macbooks
* iPads
* Apple TV
* [Chromecast Audio](https://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/)
* Printer/scanner.
* Apple Time Capsule
* No-name "[scooter computer](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-scooter-computer/)" for playing with docker.

##  Phones for kids

The big change this year was that my youngest kids got their own phones. The
process went well. I'm glad I spent the extra money to buy refurbished iPhone
5s's instead of cheaper phones. The iPhone 5s's have been reliable and easy to
administer. The 16 GB of storage has occasionally been a problem.

I restrict my youngest kids' phones so that they can't install apps. It's
tedious to have to unlock and then relock the phones to install apps for them,
but I like being able to have a say on which apps they have on their phones.

I bought Otterbox cases, which worked well at protecting the phones. So far
all the phones have survived. One phone did get dropped in the water briefly,
but it worked OK after it dried out.

The T-Mobile Simple Choice plan has worked well for us. It has a 1 GB/month
data cap per line. When you exceed the cap you still get data, but at a low
speed.

A nice bonus: T-Mobile gave everyone unlimited high-speed data for 3 months
last year. I believe the kids used an average of 2.4 GB per month while that
was available. But they seem mostly happy with the 1GB / month limit.

##  Laptops work great

The Macbooks have been great. They're used for web access and light content
creation.

##  Declining desktop usage

Our computer usage has shifted to laptops. Our desktop Mac mini computer goes
weeks between uses, and I notice that I seem to be the only one logging into
it these days.

##  Modest tablet usage

Our two tablets get relatively little usage. The mini is used for puzzle
games, the Pro is used for comic book reading, video watching, and
drawing/animation programs.

This is partially a "personal vs. shared" issue. People prefer their personal
phone and/or laptop to shared tablet.

It's also a "tool at hand" issue. I find myself using a laptop or phone rather
than a tablet just because the laptop or phone is always closer to hand.

##  Minimal Apple TV usage

Our Apple TV gets almost no usage. Its controller sucks for games, and family
members prefer to watch video on their personal laptop or phone.

Our family TV is used mostly by my wife who still likes watching broadcast TV
in the evenings.

##  What didn't go according to plan

Apple's hardware releases modified last year's plan:

* I dropped the Android TV in favor of the latest Apple TV. The Apple TV works great, but it turns out that we don't use it much.
* I exchanged my iPad Air 2 for an iPad Pro. Love the keyboard and stylus.

###  Beats headphones are low quality

I spent a lot of time this year dealing with broken headphones. My daughter's
Beats wired headphones failed twice while under warranty. Apple was nice
enough to replace them (with refurbished headphones) each time, but it
required two trips to the Apple Store for each incident.

###  Getting rid of old electronics

For what it's worth, Amazon has a good trade-in service that buys old
electronics for a fair price. Not as good a price as you'd get on Swappa or
craigslist, but zero hassle. I used it to get rid of a bunch of old consumer
electronics gear that I'd accumulated over the years.

##  Best hardware purchases

* Phone holders for the cars.
* Multi-port USB chargers for car.
* Multi-port USB chargers for bedside.
* Short (4 inch) USB cables for bedside charging.
* Long (10 foot) USB cables for car and couch.
* External battery packs for recharging phones.

##  Plans for 2016-2017

* Keep current phones & laptops.
  * I will upgrade to the latest iPhone just because I need it for my work.
* A Sony Playstation 4 NEO.
  * My son is desperate to play the latest video games.
* Support school-issued Windows laptops.

###  Keeping current hardware

I'm happy with my current hardware. The equipment is reliable and easy to
administer. There doesn't seem to be anything significantly better on the
market or on the horizon.

My kids report that the iPhone 5s is the current "standard" phone model among
their classmates. (6th grade and 8th grade). So at the moment there isn't any
social pressure to upgrade. My son would like a larger screen and a bigger
battery. I got him an external battery pack, we'll see if that helps.

Apple is rumored to be introducing new Mac hardware this year, but based on
rumors it doesn't seem to be significantly better for our budget and use cases
than our current hardware.

##  Consoles vs PC gaming

My son's grown out of Minecraft, and now wants to play teen games.

In the past few years Macs have stopped being able to run modern games. mostly
due to Apple not supporting recent 3D graphics APIs.

High-end gaming PCs work well for games, but they're expensive to buy and
maintain.

A console seems like the best choice for us. Based on performance and
exclusives I'm leaning towards the Sony Playstation 4. A new version of the
PS4 is rumored to be coming out in October. I'll probably get that.

##  Return of Windows devices

The big change to my home network this year will be dealing with school-issued
Windows laptops. I want to keep the Windows devices off my home network, but I
also want to give them access to the Internet and to a local printer. I think
the simplest way to do this is to buy a new Wi-Fi printer, and put the laptops
and printer on a guest network.

I could get a fancy router and set up multiple virtual networks, but buying a
second printer seems simpler. Perhaps if the second printer supports cloud
printing I can use it from all my devices, and then retire my current printer.

I think the whole idea of a local network is becoming obsolete. In many cases
it's simpler to assume that every device is always on the public internet, and
just configure the device to survive in that environment. The only devices in
my house that really need to be behind a firewall are the printer and the NAS.

###  Slimming down

If anything, I might simplify my home network by retiring the desktop computer
and the NAS.

In the past I used the NAS for storing backups and downloaded videos. But
these days I use cloud services for both backups and videos. I rarely use the
NAS.

I rarely use my scooter computer. It was educational to set it up, but I don't
really use it.
