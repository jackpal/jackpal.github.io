title: Xbox 360 Fall 2007 update adds DIVX/MP4 video support
---

The Fall 2007 Xbox 360 dashboard update (coming December 4th) will add support
for DivX and MP4 playback.

This is great news for Xbox 360 owners who want to watch
video encoded in these formats. I'm surprised that Microsoft did this, because
these formats compete with Microsoft's own WMV format. While the benefit to
consumers is obvious, I'm not sure what the benefit is to Microsoft. I'm
guessing they did this to both improve the "watch your PC's videos on your
Xbox" story, and also to match an existing PS3 feature.
