This weekend I wrote a JavaScript version of my old Atari 800 game Dandy.

Check it out: [Web Dandy](http://jackpal.github.io/Dandy-Dungeon/)

It was my first JavaScript application. It was about as easy as writing the
Python version. I have only tested it in two browsers so far (Firefox 3.0 and
Chrome), and only on one platform, OSX. I have already run into differences
between the two browsers: Firefox 3.0 for OSX seems to double-post keydown
events.

No sound or multiplayer yet. Oh, and I use the CANVAS tag, so I think older
browsers (like IE 7) won't work.
