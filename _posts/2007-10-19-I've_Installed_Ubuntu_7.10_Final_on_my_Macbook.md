title: I've Installed Ubuntu 7.10 Final on my Macbook
---

I was up early this morning to get the Ubuntu 7.10 final release. I used the
Ubuntu torrent (1700 downloaders) to download the file, and had the ISO image
within an hour. Pretty neat!

In theory I didn't actually need to install
Ubuntu 7.10 final. In theory it would be just as good to start with a late
release candidate and apply patches. But I wanted a clean start.

I did run
into an odd glitch during the install: the Macbook LCD display was corrupted
when I first booted up off the LiveCD. I did a cold reboot and all was well.
Go figure.
