Curious about the internal designs of GPUs, CPUs, and game consoles? Tired of
lame articles full of uninformed speculation and fanboy rants? Then check out
the archives of the "[Hot Chips](http://www.hotchips.org/archives/)"
conference, an annual conference where computer chip designers get together to
brag about their latest chips. The conference presentation slides are all
online, and they're full of good technical information on GPUs, CPUs. and even
game consoles. Of course, presenters often gloss over any technical problems
with their chips, so you won't get the full picture. But these presentations
offer a detailed technical look inside otherwise secret system architectures.

(For what it's worth the web site is poorly organized, and many links are
broken -- you sometimes have to edit the URLs slightly to find the correct
links.)
