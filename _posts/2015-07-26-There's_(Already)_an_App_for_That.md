title: There's (Already) an App for That
---

Story of my hobby hacking life these days:

1. Think of an idea for a small application to write to learn a new technology and incidentally make my life better.
2. Prototype the app.
3. Plan a MVP, estimate costs in time and money to develop.
4. Search Play Market and/or IOS App Store, find that reasonable equivalent already exists, and is only $2.
5. Buy the existing app, get on with life.

This happened to me last week with the concept of a "comic book reader". I
wrote a prototype that let me browse my collection. I was starting to list out
all the features I needed to add (zooming, panning, sorting,RAR archive
support...). And then I did a web search for comic book reader, spent a couple
of minutes reading reviews, and bought one of the popular ones for $2. Sure
it's got UI issues, and bugs, and doesn't quite work like it should, but I
saved myself weeks of development time.

I need to think through how best to spend my hacking time in today's world of
super abundance. What's my
[comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) in this new
world? What's my
[compliment](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html)?
What am I trying to learn, trying to achieve? What is worth working on?
Existential questions on a Sunday morning. :-)
