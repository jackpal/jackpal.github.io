title: How about that new Verizon Droid?
---

I've been working part time on the "Droid" project for the last year, and it
finally shipped today. I wrote some of the graphics libraries.

At first I was skeptical of the industrial design. The early prototypes looked
very much like a 1970's American car dashboard. But Motorola really improved
the industrial design in subsequent versions. I like the high-grip rubber on
the battery cover. It makes the phone very comfortable to hold.

The phone hardware is very fast, and the high resolution screen is beautiful.
I think people will enjoy owning and using this phone.

My favorite feature is the turn-by-turn navigation software. My second
favorite feature is the "Droooid" default notification sound. Oh, and the
camera flashlight is very nice too!
