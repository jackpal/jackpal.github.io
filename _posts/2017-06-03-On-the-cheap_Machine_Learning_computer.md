title: On-the-cheap Machine Learning computer
---

I recently put together a cheap-and-cheerful machine-learning-capable PC.

[Parts List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wwyQ2R)

Highlights are:

* Pentium G4560 CPU
* NVIDIA 1060 6GB GPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 512 GB SSD

The main difference from a budget gaming rig is that I chose a relatively
overpowered GPU. This is because for machine learning I think the main
bottleneck will be GPU RAM size. This particular GPU model has a lot of RAM
(6GB) for a relatively low price.

The other extravagance is the 512 GB SSD. It would have been cheaper to use a
smaller SSD coupled with a traditional hard drive. I went with a single SSD
because I don't want to deal with the hard drive.

So far my son's done far more gaming than I've done machine learning. He likes
the system a lot. It's >10x the graphics performance of his previous machine,
a 2012 Mac Mini running Windows 10 in Bootcamp.
