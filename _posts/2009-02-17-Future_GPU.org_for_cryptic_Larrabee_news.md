title: Future GPU.org for cryptic Larrabee news
---

Phil Taylor, a long-time Microsoft graphics and gaming evangelist is now
working for Intel on graphics tools evangelism. He started a blog, called
[Future GPU](http://www.futuregpu.org/), where he drops hints and links about
Larrabee development. He also tells Microsoft war stories for people in the
mood for inside-baseball information about Microsoft's DirectX and game
groups.

Back when I was working at WebTV and just learning about the 3D
graphics world, Phil was nice enough to give me and a few of my WebTV co-
workers tickets to the super-desirable GDC DirectX party. These parties were
intended for external developers, so it was very hard for non-DirectX
Microsofties to attend. Thanks Phil!!! :-)

From reading Phil's blog it sounds
like
[Intel's developing a set of graphics debugging tools that they're going to announce at GDC](https://www.cmpevents.com/GD09/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=9262).
Could it be PIX-for-Larrabee?

I found Phil's site through a "[Google Alert](http://www.google.com/alerts)"
that I set up for Larrabee news. It does a weekly search for Larrabee news.
The web's so big and sparsely connected
that I'm finding that I've never heard of any of the web sites that the Alert
is dredging up. Most of the sites mentioned in the Google Alert are not worth
visiting, but a few (like Phil's site) are very interesting indeed.
