# ThinLisp

Some notes on ThinLisp, a dialect of Lisp for real-time systems. Thin Lisp was
written by Gensym Corporation in the '90s. The general idea is that you
develop your program using a subset of Common Lisp, and then compile it into
efficient C. Garbage collection is avoided by using object pools, arenas, and
similar tricks familiar to advanced C programmers.

The current home of
ThinLisp seems to be [Vladimir Sedach's Code
Page](http://vsedach.googlepages.com/code.html) . Vladimir seems to have used
it for "one small OpenGL" project before abandoning it. He seems to be happily
hacking [ParenScript](http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/) (a Lisp to
Javascript translator) these days.

The Scheme guys have similar, but more
modest, sysems: [Schelp](http://www-
swiss.ai.mit.edu/%7Ejaffer/Docupage/schlep.html), and PreScheme (part of
[Scheme48](http://s48.org/)).
