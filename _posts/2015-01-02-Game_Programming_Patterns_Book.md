title: Game Programming Patterns Book
---

I've been reading [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Bob Nystrom.

It's available to [read online for free](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html), as well as for
purchase in a variety of formats.

A good book for people who are writing a video game engine. I found myself
agreeing with pretty much everything in this book.

Note - this book is about internal software design. It's not about game
design, or graphics, physics, audio, input, monetization strategies, etc. So
you won't be able to write a hit video game after reading this book. But if
you happen to be writing an engine for a video game, this book will help you
write a better one.

Edit -- and I've finished reading it. It was a quick read, but a good one. I
consider myself an intermediate level game developer. I've written a few
simple games and I've worked on several other games. (For example, I've ported
Quake to many different computers over the years.)

For me the most educational chapters were [Game Loop](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) and
[Component](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html), although
[Bytecode](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html) and
[Data Locality](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html) were also
quite interesting.

I like that the chapters have links to relevant external documents for further
research.

I felt smarter after reading this book.
