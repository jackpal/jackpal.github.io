# Ubuntu 9.10 gets a clue!

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the latest version of Ubuntu, 9.10 b1,
comes with a nice selection of desktop backgrounds. This makes a huge
difference in how beginners perceive the product, at very little cost to
Ubuntu. The new dark-brown default color scheme is also an improvement over
the older schemes.
