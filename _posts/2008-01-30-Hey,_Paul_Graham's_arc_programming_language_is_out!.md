title: Hey, Paul Graham's arc programming language is out!
---

I just noticed (while reading the 4chan prog forum for the first time) that
Paul Graham has put up a web site for his minimal Lisp language Arc:
[Arc](http://arclanguage.org/) The language looks like a nice quiet Scheme-like
Lisp dialect. And it has [a nice tutorial](http://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt),
as you would expect from a Paul Graham language.
