title: Blender 2.5 alpha 0 is looking pretty good
---

The open-source [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org/) DCC tool has long
suffered from an ugly, non-standard, hard-to-learn UI. I'm very happy to see
that the latest release, which just entered alpha status, has a much improved
UI. It's not quite Modo quality, but it's starting to get into the same league
as commercial DCC tools.
