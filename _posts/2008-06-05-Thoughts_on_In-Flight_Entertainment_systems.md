title: Thoughts on In-Flight Entertainment systems
---

I recently spent a lot of time using two different in-flight entertainment
systems: one on Eva Air, and another on Virgin Atlantic. For people who
haven't flown recently, I should explain that these systems consist of a
touch-sensitive TV monitor combined with a remote-control-sized controller.
The systems typically offer music, TV, movies, flight status, and video games.

I believe both systems were based on Linux. I saw the Eva system crash and
reboot, and the Virgin Air system has a number of Linux freeware games.

The
GUI frameworks were pretty weak -- both systems made poor use of the touch
screen and had obvious graphical polish issues. The Virgin system was much
higher resolution, and was 16:9 aspect ratio. I expect it was running on
slightly higher-spec hardware.

Both systems worked pretty well for playing
music and watching TV or movies. The media controls were pretty limited -
neither system allowed seeking to a particular point in a movie, or even
reliably fast forwarding. Both systems provided enough media to entertain your
average customer for the duration of the flight.

One cool feature of the EVA
system was backwards compatibility mode with the older "channel" music system
from the 70's. The controller came with the traditional "channel" UI. If you
used the channel buttons, the system simply acted like the old system, cycling
through a limited number of preset channels. One nice difference from the old
channel system is that these new virtual channels always started when you
switched to them, rather than having to join the looping presentation at
whatever point it happened to be in.

The game portions of both sysetems were
very weak. None of the games were very good. Perhaps the best game was a port
of the shareware Doom game on the Virgin Atlantic system. (I used an in-flight
entertainment system on Singapore Air many years ago that had Nintendo games.
It was more fun.)

The Virgin system allowed you to order food and drink, which
was nice. Both systems had credit card swipers, and offered some for-pay
options.

Both systems allowed you to make in-flight phone calls. EVA allowed
you to send SMS messages and emails. Both systems allowed you to create "play
lists" of music tracks that would then be played while you did other tasks. I
enjoyed this, but I suspect it's not used much, as anyone with the
sophistication and interest to use this UI would probably have their own MP3
player.

The Virgin system had two other very nice features: 1) laptop power in
most seats (although only two plugs for every three seats), and 2) Ethernet
connections. Unfortunately the ethernet connections were not yet active.

Virgin allowed you to "chat" between seats. I didn't try this, but it seems
like it would be fun for some situations (e.g. when a high school class takes
a trip.) I expect that the Doom game can play between seats as well, but
didn't investigate.

Virgin also had normal mini stereo headphone plugs, which
I think was a good idea. Eva had two kinds of audio plug, but neither one was
the normal mini stereo plug. I tried using "Skull candy" noise-canceling
headphones with the Virgin system, and while they helped suppress the airplane
noise, they didn't eliminate it completely.

It will be interesting to see how
these systems evolve over time. I think that once in-plane internet access
becomes practical people will prefer to surf the Internet to using most of the
other services. (besides movie watching) And with the in-seat power, I think
many people will prefer using their own laptop to the in-seat system. On the
other hand, the in-seat system is very space efficient. There's a chance
people will use it as a remote display for their own laptop or mobile phone,
which could then remain tucked away in the carry-on luggage.
