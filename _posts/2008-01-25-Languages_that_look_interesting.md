title: Languages that look interesting
---

Currently I'm reading up on the following computer languages:

[Python](http://python.org/) \- fun, easy to learn, batteries included

[Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org/) \- fun like Python, but with macros and type
declarations so that it can run fast.

[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) \- very
brief code. I'm impressed by how concise the Wings3D source code is.

[Typed Scheme](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/typed-scheme/) \- Scheme with type
checking. (Could in theory run fast.)

I may try implementing my old "Dandy"
game in these languages to see how they feel.
