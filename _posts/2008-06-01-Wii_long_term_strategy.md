The thesis is that the mainstream video game market arms race of every-more-
complicated games ended up overshooting enough of the potential game market to
allow an opening for simpler "down-market" games, and that Wii was able to

market, producing more complicated games over time, pushing PS3 and Xbox 360
into very up-market niches. Sort of how consoles took over from PC games.
