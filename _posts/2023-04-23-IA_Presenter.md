I just finished beta testing the [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter) Markdown-based presentation software.

tl/dr: It's really good! But it's not for me.

What it is: A macOS app that enables you to quickly create
great looking slideshow presentations using a slightly
enhanced version of Markdown.

Why I liked it:

+ Delightfully easy to use
+ Gorgeous presentation defaults
+ Opinionated tutorial, teaches you to make better presentations

Why it's not for me:

+ My workplace uses [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/).
+ I don't create presentations except for work.
+ While iA Presenter can be used to create Markdown-based blog posts,
  it's priced for professional users, which makes it too
  expensive for hobby use.

Anyway, I had fun using it, and I wish iA well in
their launch and in their future endeavors.
