Here's the first public version of the slides from Tom Forsyth and Michael
Abrash's GDC 2009 talks on Larrabee's instruction set, by way of Japanese
magazine PC Watch, as seen on Beyond 3D's Forums. (You have to manually click
on each of the little thumbnails of each slide.):

Hopefully Intel
(or GDC) will release a better version of these slide decks sometime soon.

Say, was it just me, or was blogging really light about GDC this year? In past
years I was a lot more technical writeups than I saw this year. I wonder if
blogging is down in general? Is everyone on Facebook and Twitter now? I can't
imagine Twitter being very useful for reporting technical information.

Here's Michael Abrash's Doctor Dobbs Journal article on the Larrabee instruction set.
