title: "Pixar Quality Graphics" is 720 Gflops
---

For at least 10 years GPU vendors have been talking about "Pixar Quality"
graphics. But what does that mean? Well, according to this lecture on
[The Design of Renderman](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs448a-01-fall/lectures/lecture16/walk002.html),
the original goals for the REYES architecture were

* 3000 x 1667 pixels (5 MP)
* 80M Micropolygons (each 1/4th of a pixel in size, depth complexity of 4)
* 16 samples per pixel
* 150K geometric primitives
* 300 shading flops per micropolygon
* 6 textures per primitive
* 100 1MB textures

That's a shading rate of 80M * 300 * 30 Hz = 720 Gflops. (They were probably
more concerned about 24 Hz, but for games 30Hz is better.)

In comparison I
think the peak shader flops of high-end 2008-era video cards are in the 1
TFlop range. (Xbox 360 Xenos is 240 Gflops, PS3 is a bit less.). Now, GPU
vendors typically quote multiply-accumulate flops, because that doubles the
number of flops. So it's more realistic to say that 2008-era video cards are
in the 500 Gflop range. So we really are entering the era of "Pixar Quality"
graphics.
