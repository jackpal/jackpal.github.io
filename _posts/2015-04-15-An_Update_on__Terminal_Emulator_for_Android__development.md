title: An Update on "Terminal Emulator for Android" development
---

I am shutting down "[Terminal Emulator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&hl=en)"
[development](https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator) again.

Why am I doing this?

* I have lost interest in the core idea of an on-device terminal emulator.
* Maintaining project, even in its mostly stable state, is taking up too much of my time.
* I do not want to give control of the app to other developers, for fear that they will ruin the app by adding bugs, ads, in-app purchases, or malware.

What this means:

* I will make one or two more releases based on the current source tree. (Which has a few small bug fixes.)
* I will be closing all open bugs as "won't fix".
* I will be rejecting all future pull requests.

What you should do:

* If you're a user, the app will continue to be available in its current state.
* If you're a developer, you are welcome to fork the app to start your own version. Maybe get together with other developers and make something great!
