# ICFP 2009 contest final scores

Final scores are out, and my team Blue Iris scored [80 out of
328](http://icfpcontest.org/scoreboard.php) in this year's ICFP contest. Not
as good as last year, ah well. :-) Next year: More sleep!

And here's a video of [the contest results presentation from
ICFP](http://www.vimeo.com/6613815).
