title: Insomniac Games Shares Technology
---

One very nice habit of Western game companies is that many of them share their
technical knowledge with competitors. Insomniac Games is a very good third
party console game developer that has concentrated mostly on the PlayStation
platform. Their recent games include the shooter "Resistance Fall of Man" and
the action platform Rachet and Clank series.

At this year's GDC they announced
the "[Nocturnal](http://nocturnal.insomniacgames.com/)" initiative. It's not a
whole game engine, but rather a collection of useful utilities. Things like
logging code, C++ object serialization, and a cross-platform performance
monitor. Some of the utilities are Playstation 3 specific, but most are
applicable to any modern game platform.

Much of this code would be right at
home in a "Game Gems" book, but it's even better to have it freely available,
on the web, with a BSD-style license. Good for you Insomniac!

Insomniac also
publishes technical papers in a GDC-presentation-like format on their [Game R
& D Page](http://www.insomniacgames.com/tech/techpage.php).

Why do so many
game companies share information like this? I think it's for a number of
mutually supportive reasons:

1. It's a form of advertising, to show off how smart and competent the developers are. This is helpful in attracting job applicants and impressing publishers and game reviewers.
2. It educates all game developers, some of whom will eventually end up working for the original developer.
3. It encourages other developers to share their technology, which benefits the original game developers.
4. It reduces the value of middleware, driving down the cost of middleware.

Game developers can give away source code because, unlike other kinds of
software, the major intellectual property in the game is in the copyrighted
and trademarked art assets, (the data) rather than in the code. Yet, at the
same time, game quality is directly tied to the performance of the code. This
creates a unique economy in which it is profitable for game developers to
exchange performance tips with their competitors.

And it's a lot of fun for
armchair developers like me. Now if only we can get Naughty Dog to open-source
their GOOL and GOAL Lisp-based game engines. :-)
