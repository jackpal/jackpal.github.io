title: 2018 iPad Pro 12.9" Report
---

After weeks of research and thought, I bought a iPad Pro 12.9" 3rd Generation.

My impressions, based on a week's use:

* It's too expensive, especially once you include the pencil and keyboard case.
* It's a significant improvement over the 1st generation iPad Pro 12.9".
  * It's physically much smaller.
  * The new keyboard is nicer.
  * The new pencil's magnetic charger makes it much more useful than before, because now it's always charged when I want to use it.
* Flaws
  * The magnets holding the pencil to the iPad are too weak. It's easy to knock the pencil off the edge of the iPad when picking it up or carrying it.
  * When the keyboard case is folded back, your hands touch the keys. This feels weird at first.
  * The hardware is held back by iOS 12 and Apple App Store limitations.

FWIW I think for most people the ordinary 2018 iPad, with a Logitech Crayon,
would be a better purchase.

But I do enjoy using it!
