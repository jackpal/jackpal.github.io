title: I published my first Android app
---

Now that the Android Native Development Kit has been released, I was finally
able to publish the sources and binary to my [Android Terminal Emulator](http://code.google.com/p/androidterm/).
It's a fairly plain Digital Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal emulator, with some features from newer
terminals (like colors.)

This is my first application in the Android Market. There are at least 10
other terminal emulators in the market; we'll see how this one is received.

A bit of history: This was my first Android application. I wrote it for the
original "Sooner" Android devices, and have kept it updated for the successive
generations of devices. It requires native code because there's no public
Android Java APIs for dealing with PTYs.

A bit of ancient history: I wrote two terminal emulators for the Atari 800
back in the day: Chameleon, in 6502 assembly, and a version of Kermit in the
excellent "Action!" programming language. Kermit was one of my first "open
source" programs. If you poke around on the web you can still find it
[here and there](http://atariwiki.strotmann.de/xwiki/bin/view/Code/ACTIONKermit).
