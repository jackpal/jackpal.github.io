I've been reading the book [Masters of Doom](http://books.google.com/books/about/Masters_of_Doom.html?id=yyaxyKjyp2YC)
about the careers of John Carmack and John Romero. I have ported their games
Doom and Quake to [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV)
[different](http://dxquake.sourceforge.net/)
[platforms](https://github.com/jackpal/glesquake). It was interesting to read
about their lives and game business.

The book brought back memories of development in the '80's, and '90s. Things
were simpler (and worse) then.
