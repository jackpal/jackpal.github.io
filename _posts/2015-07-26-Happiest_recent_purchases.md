A few products that made my summer family travels happier:

[Photive 6 port Desktop USB Charger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9orpvnu_GVE).

Anker 4-port USB car cigaret lighter charger.

Car vent phone holder (don't remember the brand.)

Short stereo audio cable. It's ghetto compared to bluetooth, but more
reliable.
