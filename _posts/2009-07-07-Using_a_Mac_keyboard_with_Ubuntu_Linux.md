# Using a Mac keyboard with Ubuntu Linux

I frequently switch between Mac and Linux, and it's been troublesome to
remember to type Command-whatever on the Mac, but Control-whatever on Linux.
(For copy-and paste, for example.)

I did a quick web search and found out that it's easy to
[make Ubuntu Linux recognize the Command keys as an extra set of control keys](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-975229.html):

```
Choose menu: System : Preferences : Keyboard
Select the Layouts tab
Choose "Layout Options"
Open the "Alt / Win Key Behaviour" tab
Check the "Control is mapped to the Win-keys" checkbox.
```
