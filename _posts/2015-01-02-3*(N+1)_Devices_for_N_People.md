title: 3*(N+1) Devices for N People
---

At my house we are trending towards having N+1 laptops for N people, because
(a) I need to keep my work laptop separate from my home laptop, and (b)
frequently everyone in the family wants to use their laptops _at the same
time_.

The same goes for tablets, and when the kids are old enough to have phones I
expect it will be the same for phones.

I tried using multi-user accounts on shared family tablets and laptops, but
ended up assigning each kid their own devices. It was simpler from an account
management point of view, and the kids like personalizing their devices with
stickers and cases.

Having assigned devices also makes it easier to give different Internet and
gaming privileges to different kids, depending on age and maturity.

A downside of assigned devices is that not all the devices have the same
features. People complain about hand-me-down devices, as well as the perverse
incentive created when an accidentally broken device is replaced by a brand
new, better device.
