title: Dropping a Dynabook: A comic that turned from Science Fiction to Science Fact
---

Some time around 1982, I saw an amazing comic on the wall of a [Xerox
Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto) computer room at the [MIT AI
Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory).
Given the subject matter, I assume the comic was originally created at [Xerox
PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_\(company\)), possibly as part of the
[NoteTaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_NoteTaker) project, but can't
find any trace of it on the web. I have recreated it from memory, below.

The comic is explaining the events that happen when a
[Dynabook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook) is accidentally dropped off
the top of [Half Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Dome) in [Yosemite
National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park). Note
that a [free-fall calculator](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1231475371)
claims that it would take over 12 seconds for the Dynabook to hit the Yosemite
Valley floor.

T+00.000 Dynabook accidentally dropped from top of Half Dome.

T+00.016 Dynabook notices that

* It can't sense its user.
* It is in zero gravity.
* There is a 200 MPH wind from below.

Dynabook concludes that it is falling.

* Turns off the display to save memory.
* Opens a radio connection to El Capitan radio tower.
* Begins backing up the user's recent changes.


T+05.000 Dynabook hits a glancing blow to the side of Half Dome, breaking 3 of
its 6 CPUs. The Dynabook reconfigures itself to continue working with the 3
remaining CPUs.

T+10.000 User data backup finishes.

T+11.000 Dynabook orders the user a replacement Dynabook.

T+12.000 Dynabook turns on an emergency locator beacon.

T+12.816 Dynabook smashes into the rocks at the bottom of Half Dome.
