title: Larrabee papers from SIGGRAPH Asia 2008
---

...as seen on the [Beyond3D GPGPU
forum](http://forum.beyond3d.com/showthread.php?p=1251413#post1251413), here
are the presentations from the recent (December 12th 2008) "Beyond
Programmable Shading" course:

[SIGGRAPH Asia 2008: Parallel Computing for Graphics: Beyond Programmable Shading](http://sa08.idav.ucdavis.edu/)

There
are good presentations from both GPU vendors and academics. My favorite
presentations are the Intel ones on Larrabee, just because I'm so interested
in that architecture:

[Parallel Programming on Larrabee](http://sa08.idav.ucdavis.edu/foley-programming-larrabee.pdf) \-
describes the Larrabee fiber/task programming model.

[Next-Generation Graphics on Larrabee](http://sa08.idav.ucdavis.edu/foley-nextgen.pdf)
\- how Larrabee's
standard renderer is structured, and how it can be extended / modified.

IBM / Sony missed a bet by not presenting here. That's too bad, because Cell sits
between the ATI / NVIDIA parts and Larrabee in terms of programmability. And
Cell's been available for long enough that there should be a number of
interesting results to report.

Note to self: consider buying a PS3 and
learning Cell programming, just to get ready for Larrabee. Heh, yeah, that's
the ticket. Being able to play PS3-specific games like Little Big Planet and
Flower would be just a coincidental bonus.
