# Computer History Museum Oral Histories

The [Computer History Museum Oral Histories](http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/oralhistories/) are a
wonderful project. They are deep, long, interviews with many different
programmers. Lots of never-before-made-public details about important
projects.

For example, this oral history by Oral History of Kenneth Kocienda and Richard
Williamson goes into details of how iOS was designed:

Or if you prefer PDFs:

One of the interesting things I found out was that there was an attempt to use
HTML/Web APIs to write iPhone apps, and that for the first two or three iOS
releases some of the apps, including the Stocks and Weather apps were
implemented as HTML/Web apps.
