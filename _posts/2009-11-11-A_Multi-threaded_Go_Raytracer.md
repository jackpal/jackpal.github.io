Above is the output of the raytracer. Below is a diagnostic mode showing which
goroutines raytraced which section of the screen. Each goroutine has its own
color to outline the pixels it traces:

I wrote a simple multi-threaded ray tracer in Google's new "go" language. It's
an adaptation of [Flying Frog Consultancy's
Raytracer](http://www.ffconsultancy.com/languages/ray_tracer/comparison.html).

It runs single-threaded about 1/2 the speed of a comparable C++ version. I
guess the C++ version benefits from a more optimizing compiler and the ability
to inline small functions.

Compared to ordinary C/C++, the Go version was easier to multithread.

On my dual-core Macbook Pro I get an 1.80x speedup when running with
GOMAXPROCS > 1:

```
$ GOMAXPROCS=1 time ./gotrace

**1.52** real 1.50 user 0.01 sys

$ GOMAXPROCS=2 time ./gotrace

**0.82** real 1.50 user 0.01 sys

$ GOMAXPROCS=3 time ./gotrace

**0.81** real 1.50 user 0.01 sys
```

On an eight-core, 16 Hyperthread HP Z600 running Ubuntu 9.10, (with the source
code changed to use 16 goroutines instead of the default 8 goroutines) I get a
5.8x speedup:

```
$ GOMAXPROCS=1 time ./gotrace
