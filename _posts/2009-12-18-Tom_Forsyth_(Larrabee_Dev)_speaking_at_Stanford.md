title: Tom Forsyth (Larrabee Dev) speaking at Stanford
---

I just noticed Tom Forsyth, aka tomf, is speaking at the
[Stanford EE CS Colloquium](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/) on January 6, 2010. The
video will hopefully be posted on the web afterwards.

The topic is "To be announced", but is very likely to be Larrabee related.
