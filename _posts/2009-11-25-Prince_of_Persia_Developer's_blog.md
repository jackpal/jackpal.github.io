title: Prince of Persia Developer's blog
---

In the late 1980's Jordan Mechner single-handedly designed and programmed the
original Apple II version of
[Prince of Persia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_\(1989_video_game\)) and
several other groundbreaking games. He published his
[development journals](http://jordanmechner.com/old-journals/) and
[technical design documents](http://jordanmechner.com/wp-content/uploads/1989/10/popsource009.pdf) on his web site.

The journals touch on:

* The development of the stop-motion animation techniques used so effectively in PoP
* The tension in Jordan's life between his two callings: game development and feature film scriptwriting / directing.
* The difficulties involved in developing and selling a new game idea.
* A view into the late 80's / early 90's pre-web game development business.

Although many games are now written by large teams of people, in the end, a
lot of the business, artistic, and technical issues Jordan writes about remain
relevant. I highly recommend these journals for anyone interested in an inside
view of game development. (Or anyone interested in trying to break into
Hollywood. :-) )
