title: I saw the original Spacewar! on a PDP-1 today
---

I went to the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/)
today. I saw the Visual Storage exhibit, which is a collection of famous
computers, the Babbage Difference Engine, which is a very elaborate
reproduction of a never-actually-built Victorian era mechanical calculator,
and the PDP-1 demo. This last demo was very special to me, because I finally
got to play the original [Spacewar!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar%21)
game, and meet and chat with [Steve
Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell), the main developer.
(Perusing Wikipedia I now realize that Steve was also an early Lisp hacker.
D'Oh!, I was going to ask a question about Lisp on the PDP-1, but I got
distracted.)

There's a [Java Spacewar! emulator](http://spacewar.oversigma.com/), but it doesn't properly convey the
look of the PDP-1 radar-scope-based display. The scope displays individual
dots, 20,000 times per second. Each dot starts as a fuzzy bright blue-white
dot, but then fades quickly to a dim yellow-green spot, which takes another 10
seconds to fade to black. This means that dim yell0w-green trails form behind
the ships as they fly around. These trails add a lot to the game's distinctive
look. (In addition, due to time multi-plexing, the stars of the starfield are
much dimmer than the space ships or the sun.) The fuzzyness of the dots means
that the spaceships look much smoother on the PDP-1 scope than they do in the
Java simulator.

According to Steve Russel and the other docents, the Java
version also runs faster than a real PDP-1.

I also got to see serveral other
cool PDP-1 hacks, including the original Munching Squares, 4-voice square-wave
computer synthezed music, and the famed Minskeytron. The author of the music
synth program, [Peter
Sampson](http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=theme&s=4&ss=5), was
present, and explained how he carefully patched into four of the console
lights to make a four-voice D/A converter to get music out of the machine.

They keep all the hacks loaded into the PDP-1 core at the same time, and just
use the front panel to decide which one to jump to. The core memory is non-
volitile. The PDP-1 even booted in a few seconds -- just the time it took the
power supply to come up to speed.

The PDP-1 demo is given twice a month, on
the second and fourth Saturdays. I highly recommend it for adults and children
over 12. (It's 45 minutes long, so younger kids might get bored.)
