title: TaxCut 2007 vs. Case-sensitive file systems
---

OS X allows you to format your file system as case-insensitive (the default)
or case sensitive (like Linux.) I use case-sensitive, to simplify porting and
working on Linux software.

Unfortunately, H&R Block's TaxCut 2008 program
won't work if installed on a case-sensitive file system. It fails because it
can't find files, probably due to differences between the case of the file
name used by the programmer and the actual case of the file name on disk.

A work-around is to use the Disk Utility program to create a case-insensitive
image, and install Tax Cut on the image. I used a 600 MB image, so that I can
store all my tax forms there too, and eventually burn the whole thing to CD to
archive it.
