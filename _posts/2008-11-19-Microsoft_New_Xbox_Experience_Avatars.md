I
just tried creating an avatar on Microsoft's new Xbox dashboard. As you can
see (at least when the Microsoft server isn't being hammered) on the left,
they provide a URL for displaying your current Avatar on a web page.

The
character creation system is not too bad. In some ways it's more flexible than
Nintendo's Mii (for example more hair styles and clothing), but in other ways
it's more limited (less control over facial feature placement).

My avatar
looks better on the Xbox than it does here -- they should consider sharpening
the image. For example, the T-shirt my avatar is wearing has a thin-lined Xbox
symbol.

I think they do a good job of avoiding the Uncanny Valley effect. I
look forward to seeing how avatars end up being used in the Xbox world.

In
othe Xbox-related news I'm enjoying playing Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts with my
son. All we have right now is the demo, but it's great fun for anyone who
likes building things. It's replaced Cloning Clyde as my son's favorite Xbox
game.
