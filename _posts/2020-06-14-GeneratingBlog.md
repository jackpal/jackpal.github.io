title: Publish Swift-based Site Generator

I've been using John Sundell's [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) static site generator to create this web site.

It's a good tool, but woefully under-exampled.

The best resources I've found (besides reading the source) are:

+ [Ordinary Coding - Generating a static web site](https://ordinarycoding.com/articles/generating-static-website/)
+ [Source to site https://www.staskus.io](https://github.com/nitesuit/Blog)
