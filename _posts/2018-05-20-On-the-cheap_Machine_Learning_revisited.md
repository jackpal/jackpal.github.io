title: On-the-cheap Machine Learning, revisited
---

A short update on my
[On the Cheap Machine Learning](https://jackpal.github.io/posts/2017/06/On-the-cheap_Machine_Learning_computer/)
blog post. After almost a year of use, I’m still pretty happy
with the setup. The hardware has worked well. I haven’t done as much
independent ML research as I had hoped, but I have contributed many hours of
night-time GPU cycles to the [Leela Zero](https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero)
open-source Go-game-AI project. I don’t think I would change anything about
the build, and there’s nothing about it I want to upgrade yet.

However, in the past year a new option has appeared for on-the-cheap machine
learning: Google’s [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)
project. Colaboratory is a free web-based IDE for writing machine learning
applications. What’s especially cool about it is that comes with access to a
cloud-based GPU. The GPU they provide is the NVIDIA K80, which is not the
fastest GPU, but it’s still plenty fast for experimenting with machine
learning. [Disclosure: I work for Google, but not in any groups related to
Google Colaboratory.]

Colaboratory puts machine learning within the reach of anyone with a modern
web browser, even if that browser is on a device (like a laptop, tablet, or
even phone) that doesn’t have a high-end GPU.

I find myself using Colaboratory instead of my own desktop computer simply
because my son’s often using my desktop computer for schoolwork, YouTube and
playing games.
