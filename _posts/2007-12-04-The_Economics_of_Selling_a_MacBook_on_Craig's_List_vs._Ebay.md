title: The Economics of Selling a MacBook on Craig's List vs. Ebay
---

I just sold my MacBook over the web. I sold it on [Craig's
List](http://www.craigslist.org/). I also considered using
[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/), but Craig's List turned out to be a better deal,
for both buyer and seller.

The reason is that listing and selling on Craig's
List is free, while selling on eBay is expensive, especially for items priced
higher than $500. First, there's the listing fee of $0.20, then the Final
Value fee of $0.50 + 3.25% * price. But wait, there's more: EBay all-but-
requires you to use their PayPal service to settle transactions, and PayPal in
turn requires you to use a "Premier" account if you receive more than $500 in
eBay payments in one month, which you automatically would if the item you're
selling is more than $500. Using a "Premier" account requires that you pay
PayPal 2.9%+$0.30 per transaction, even for cash transactions. (The processing
fee is less if you are doing a high volume of business through them.)

So the
total eBay selling cost is in the range of 6.15%. That's $50 on a $800 item.

You could avoid accepting PayPal, but since accepting PayPal is the norm on
eBay, it's very likely that your auction will be shunned, and you will receive
a lower price.

Besides the hefty fees, using PayPal is riskier for the seller
than using cash. This is because it is possible for a disgruntled buyer to
reverse the transaction. (Of course this same ability is a plus for the buyer,
as is the ability to use credit cards.)

Even without using eBay to sell the
product, it makes sense to use eBay as a price setter. eBay makes this easy to
do by reporting the final price for closed auctions that you are "watching".
Since auctions last between 3 and 10 days, and an auction must be active in
order for you to watch it, you will need at least a week to track enough
auctions of similar items to make a fairly accurate estimate of the market
price.
