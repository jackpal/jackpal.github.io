title: Back to Mac
---

This week I converted my family's main computer from Vista to OS X. (It's a
Mac Mini).

We pretty much use it for web surfing, web email, really old DOS
children's games, and photo editing. Macs do that pretty well.

I still have a
Vista machine that I use for the excellent Windows Media Center -- love the
record-by-keyword feature and the free programming guide.

But for day-to-day
use we're back to the Mac.
