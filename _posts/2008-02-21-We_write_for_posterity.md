title: We write for posterity
---

The Google Analytics numbers for this blog are dismal. (Hi Mom! Hi Friends!) I
think it's because right now I don't have much to say that's both unique and
interesting. Partly this is because so much of my life is off limits: I don't
want to talk about the joys & cares of raising a family, and I musn't talk
about the joys & cares of raising a new product. What's left are comments on
the general state of the web, and essays on general topics like this one.

Why
write then, and who am I writing for? I write because something inside me
compells me to, and because it helps me think to get my ideas down in written
form. Who do I write for? From my Analytics numbers it's clear that I'm
writing primarily for search engines (Hi Googlebot!) rather than people. And
that's something interesting to think about: Baring a world-wide disaster or
cultural revoloution, what I write today will persist for thousands and
probably even millions of years, and will be read countless times by search
engines, and only occasionally, if at all, by people.

My words will be torn
apart and merged with other web pages from other authors, becoming a mulch out
of which new insights will be gleaned. (Hmm, not unlike how my body will be
recyled when I die, its atoms used to make new things.)

Perhaps the last time
my essay will ever be read by a live human is in some far distant future when
some graduate student is writing an essay on early-web-era civilization, and
is trying to find out what those poor benighted souls thought of the future.
(Hi posterity!)

No doubt my words will be automatically translated from 21st-
century English into whatever language wins the world-wide language wars.
Perhaps my essay will even be automatically annotated, with a description of
who I was, and a best guess at what I looked like, from searching the world's
photo archives. There will be footnotes and links to explain the archaic
topics I'm referencing. "Search engine" - they used to store data in seperate
computers, and brute-force building the search index. How primitive! How
quaint!

And no doubt the grad-student-of-the-future will glance over my words,
then move on to the hundreds of other essays on similar themes. (Good luck
with your own essay, future-guy!)
