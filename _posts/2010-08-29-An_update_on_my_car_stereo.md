title: An update on my car stereo
---

It's been a year since
[I bought my fancy car stereo](/assets/posts/2010-08-29-An_update_on_my_car_stereo-Too_Many_Words_about_Car_Stereos.html).
I wanted to mention that I've ended up not using most of the fancy features.

* The built-in MP3 player had issues with my 1000-song / 100 album / 4 GB music collection:
  * It took a long time to scan the USB storage each time the radio turned on.
  * It was difficult to navigate the album and song lists.
  * Chinese characters were not supported.
  * It took a long time to "continue" a paused item, especially a long item like a podcast.
* The bluetooth pairing only worked with one phone at a time, which was awkward in a two-driver family.

Here's how I use it now:

* I connect my phone using both the radio's USB (so the phone is being charged) and mini stereo plugs.
* I use the phone's built-in music player.
* I have the radio set to AUX to play the music from the stereo input plug.

It's a little bit cluttered, because of the two cables, but it gets the job
done. The phone's music player UI is so much better than the radio's UI.

In effect I have reduced the car stereo to serving as a volume control, an
amplifier, and a USB charger.
