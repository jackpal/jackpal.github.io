title: A Smooth AsyncImage Replacement
---

iOS 15.0 introduced a AsyncImage SwiftUI view to enable asynchronously loading URL-based images.

AsyncImage works well for many scenarios, but has several limitations:

1. AsyncImage doesn't provide a mechanism for "inflating" the image before drawing it. This means
that large images will take a long time to render the first time that they are drawn. This can
cause "hitches" or "jank" when scrolling.

2. AsyncImage doesn't provide a mechanism for pre-scaling large UIImages down to screen size.
This can cause slow rendering and excessive memory use when displaying large images.

Here's a replacement, SmoothAsyncImage, that fixes these two problems.

Limitations:

- Unlike AsyncImage, does not work on macOS.

- Only provides the most powerful / general initializer. Implementing the
convenience initializers is left as an exercise for the reader.

``` swift
import SwiftUI
import func AVFoundation.AVMakeRect

// Drop-in replacement for AsyncImage that inflates the UIImage
// on a background thread to avoid scroll jank.
// Inspired by https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E258-asyncimage
struct SmoothAsyncImage<Content>: View where Content: View {
  private let url: URL?
  private let scale: CGFloat
  private let transaction: Transaction
  private let content: (AsyncImagePhase) -> Content

  @State private var phase = AsyncImagePhase.empty

  public init(url: URL?, scale: CGFloat = 1, transaction: Transaction = Transaction(),
              @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (AsyncImagePhase) -> Content) {
    self.url = url
    self.scale = scale
    self.transaction = transaction
    self.content = content
  }

  var body: some View {
    GeometryReader { proxy in
      let targetSize = proxy.size
      content(phase)
        .task (id: url) {
          guard let url = url else { return }
          do {
            let uiImage = try await ImageLoader.shared.load(url:url, scale:scale,
                                                            targetSize:targetSize)
            withTransaction(transaction) {
              phase = .success(Image(uiImage:uiImage))
            }
          } catch {
            withTransaction(transaction) {
              phase = .failure(error)
            }
          }

    case canceled

  /// Load an image asynchronously. The resulting image is "inflated" (decoded to pixels)
  /// before being returned. This means it will render very quickly.
