Think of an idea for a small application to write to learn a new technology and incidentally make my life better. 2. Prototype the app. 3. Plan a MVP, estimate costs in time and money to develop. 4. Search Play Market and/or IOS App Store, find that reasonable equivalent already exists, and is only $2. 5. Buy the existing app, get on with life.</p><p>This happened to me last week with the concept of a "comic book reader". I wrote a prototype that let me browse my collection. I was starting to list out all the features I needed to add (zooming, panning, sorting,RAR archive support...). And then I did a web search for comic book reader, spent a couple of minutes reading reviews, and bought one of the popular ones for $2. Sure it's got UI issues, and bugs, and doesn't quite work like it should, but I saved myself weeks of development time.</p><p>I need to think through how best to spend my hacking time in today's world of super abundance. What's my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">comparative advantage</a> in this new world? What's my <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">compliment</a>? What am I trying to learn, trying to achieve? What is worth working on? Existential questions on a Sunday morning. :-)</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
