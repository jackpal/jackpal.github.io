The contest was to design an AI for a Tron lightcycle game.</p><p>My entry used the standard min/max approach, similar to many other entries. I guess that's why it performed similarly to so many other entries. :-) I didn't have any time to investigate better algorithms, due to other obligations.</p><p>In addition to my own entry (which was in C++), I also created starter packs for JavaScript and Google's Go language. These starter packs enabled people to enter the contest using JavaScript or Go. In the end, <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/language_profile.php?lang=Go">6 people entered using Go</a>, and <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/language_profile.php?lang=JavaScript">4 people entered using JavaScript</a>. I'm pleased to have helped people compete using these languages.</p><p>I initially wanted to use JavaScript and/or Go myself, but the strict time limit of the contest strongly favored the fastest language, and that made me choose a C++ implementation. Practically speaking, there wasn't much advantage to using another language. The problem didn't require any complicated data structures, closures, or dynamic memory allocation. And the submitted entries were run on a single-hardware-thread virtual machine, which meant that there wasn't a performance benefit for using threads.</p><p>This contest was interesting because it went on for a long time (about a month) and because the contestants freely shared algorithm advice during the contest. This lead to steadily improving opponents. My program peaked at about 20th place early in the contest, but because I didn't improve it thereafter, its rank gradually declined over the rest of the contest.</p><p><a href="http://a1k0n.net/blah/archives/2010/03/index.html">The contest winner's post-mortem</a> reveals that he won by diligent trial-and-error in creating a superior evaluation function. Good job a1k0n!</p><p>Congratulations to the contest organizers for running an interesting contest very well. I look forward to seeing new contests from the University of Waterloo Computer Club in the future.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/contests">contests</a></li><li><a href="/tags/go">go</a></li><li><a href="/tags/c">C++</a></li><li><a href="/tags/javascript">JavaScript</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
