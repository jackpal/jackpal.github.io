I tried this a year ago, but was not happy with the results. But since then I've become more comfortable with using OS X, so today I thought I'd try again. Here's my quick setup notes:</p><ul><li>I'm using a Mac Mini 1.83 Core 2 Duo with 1 GB of RAM. This is the cheapest Mac Mini that Apple currently sells. I thought about getting an AppleTV, but I think the Mini is easier to modify, has more CPU power for advanced codecs, and can be used as a kid's computer in the future, if I don't like using it as an HTPC. I also have dreams of writing a game for the Mini that uses Wiimotes. I think this would be easier to do on a Mini than an AppleTV, even though the AppleTV has a better GPU.<ul><li>I'm using "Plex" as for viewing problem movies, and I think it may end up becoming my main movie viewing program. It's the OSX version of Xbox Media Center. (Which is a semi-legal program for a hacked original Xbox. The Plex version is legal because it doesn't use the unlicensed Xbox code.) The UI is a little rough. (Actually, by Mac standards it's <em>very</em> rough. :-) ) Plex has very good codec support and lots of options for playing buggy or non-standard video files.</li><li>I connected my Mac Mini to my media file server using gigabit ethernet. This made Front Row feel much snappier than when I was using an 802.11g wireless connection.</li><li>I installed the <a href="http://perian.org/">Perian</a> plugin adds support for many popular codecs to Quicktime and Front Row.</li><li>I set up my Mac Mini to automatically mount my file server share at startup and when coming out of sleep. <a href="http://forums.mactalk.com.au/13/42160-solution-how-auto-reconnect-network-drive-after-resuming-sleep.html">Detailed instructions here.</a> Synopsis: Create an AppleScript utility to mount the share, put the utility in your Login Items so that it's run automatically at startup, and finally use <a href="http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/">SleepWatcher</a> to run the script after a sleep.</li><li>I added FrontRow to my Login Items (Apple Menu:System Preferences...:Accounts:Login Items) to start Front Row at startup.</li><li>I administer my Mini HTPC using VNC from a second computer. I don't have a keyboard or mouse hooked up to the HTPC normally. I disabled the Bluetooth keyboard detection dialog using Apple Menu:System Preferences...:Bluetooth:Advanced... then uncheck "Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant at startup when no input device present".</li></ul></li></ul><p>Things I'm still working on:</p><ul><li>No DVR-MS codec support in Perian, and therfore none in Front Row. I have to use my trusty Xbox 360 or VLC to view my Microsoft Windows Media Center recordings.</li></ul></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/htpc">htpc</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
