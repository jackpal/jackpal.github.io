I found myself agreeing with pretty much everything in this book.<br><br>Note - this book is about internal software design. It's not about game design, or graphics, physics, audio, input, monetization strategies, etc. So you won't be able to write a hit video game after reading this book. But if you happen to be writing an engine for a video game, this book will help you write a better one.<br><br>Edit -- and I've finished reading it. It was a quick read, but a good one. I consider myself an intermediate level game developer. I've written a few simple games and I've worked on several other games. (For example, I've ported Quake to many different computers over the years.)<br><br>For me the most educational chapters were <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">Game Loop</a> and <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html">Component</a>, although <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html">Bytecode</a> and <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html">Data Locality</a> were also quite interesting.<br><br>I like that the chapters have links to relevant external documents for further research.<br><br>I felt smarter after reading this book.<br><br></p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
