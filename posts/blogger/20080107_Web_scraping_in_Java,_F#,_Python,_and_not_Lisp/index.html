A web scraper is a program that crawls over a set of web pages, following links and collecting data. Another name for this kind of program is a "spider", because it "crawls" the web.</p><p>In the past I've written scrapers in <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>, with good results. But yesterday, when I wanted to write a new scraper, I though I'd try using a dynamically-typed language instead.</p><p>What's a dynamically-typed language you ask? Well, computer languages can generally be divided into two camps, depending on whether they make you declare the type of data that can be stored in a variable or not. Declaring the type up front can make the program run faster, but it's more work for the developer. Java and F#, the languages I previously used to write a web scraper, are statically typed languages, although F# uses type inference so you don't actually have to declare types very often -- the computer figures it out for you.</p><p>In order to scrape HTML you need three things:</p><ol><li>a language</li><li>a library that fetches HTTP pages</li><li>a library that parses the HTML into a tree of HTML tags</li></ol><p>Unless you're using Mono or Microsoft's Common Language Runtime, the language you choose will restrict the libraries that you can use.</p><p>So, the first thing I needed to do was choose a dynamic language. Since I just finished reading "<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>", an excellent advanced tutorial on the Lisp language, I though I'd try using Lisp. But that didn't work out very well at all. Lisp has neither a standard implementation nor a set of standard libraries for downloading web pages and parsing HTML. I did some Googling to try and find some combination of parts that would work for me. Unfortunately, it seemed that every web page I visited recommended a different combination of libraries, and none of the combinations I tried worked for me. In the end I just gave up in frustration.</p><p>Then, I turned to <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. I had not used Python much, but I knew it had a reputation as an easy-to-use language with a lot of easy-to-use libraries. And you know what? It really was easy! I did some web searches, copied some example code, and voila, I had a working web spider in about an hour. And the program was easy to write every step of the way. I used the standard CPython implementation for the language, Python's built-in urllib2 library to fetch the web data, and the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> library for parsing the HTML.</p><p>How does the Python compare to Java and F# for web scraping?</p><p>Python Benefits:</p><ul><li>Very brief, easy to write code</li><li>Libraries built in or easy to find</li><li>Lots of web examples</li><li>I didn't have to think: I just used for loops and subroutine calls.</li><li>Very fast turn-around.</li><li>Easy to create and iterate over lists of strings.</li></ul><p>Python non-issues for this application:</p><ul><li>Didn't matter that the language was slow, because this task is totally I/O bound.</li><li>Didn't matter that the IDE is poor, using print and developing interactively was fine</li></ul><p>F# Benefits:</p><ul><li>Good IDE (Visual Studio)</li><li>Both URL fetching and HTML parsing libraries built in to CLR</li></ul><p>F# Non-issues:</p><ul><li>Small community, few examples. (A non-issue because there is <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/94.aspx">an example of how to write a multi-threaded web scraper</a>!)</li></ul><p>F# Drawbacks:</p><ul><li>The CLR libraries for URL fetching and HTML parsing are more difficult to use than Python. It takes more steps to complete similar operations.</li><li>Strong typing gets in the way of writing simple code.</li><li>odd language syntax compared to Algol-derived languages.</li><li>Hard-to-understand error messages from the compiler.</li><li>Mixed functional/imperative programming is more complicated than just imperative programing.</li><li>The language and library encourages you to use advanced concepts to do simple things. In my web scraper I wrote a lot of classes and had methods that took complicated curried functions as arguments. This made the code hard to debug. In retrospect perhaps I should have just used lists of strings, the same as I did in Python. Since F# supports lists of strings pretty well, maybe this is my problem rather than F#'s. ;-)</li></ul><p>Java benefits:</p><ul><li>Good debugger</li><li>Good libraries</li><li>Multithreading</li></ul><p>Java drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Very wordy language</li><li>Very wordy libraries</li></ul><p>Lisp drawbacks:</p><ul><li>No standard implementation</li><li>No standard libraries</li></ul><p>Looking to the future, I'd be interested in writing a web scraper in IronPython, which has good IDE support, and in C# 3.0, which has some support for type inference.</p><p>In any event, I'm left with a very favorable impression of Python, and plan to look into it some more. In the past I was put off from it because it was slow, but now I see how useful it is when speed doesn't matter.</p><p>[Note: When I first wrote this article I was under the impression that CPython didn't support threads. I since discovered (by reading the Python in a Nutshell book) that it does support threads. Once I knew this, I was able to easily add multi-threading to the web scraper. CPython's threads are somewhat limited: only one thread is allowed to run Python code at a time. But that's fine for this application, where the multiple threads spend most of their time blocked waiting for C-based network I/O ]</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/java">Java</a></li><li><a href="/tags/f">F#</a></li><li><a href="/tags/lisp">Lisp</a></li><li><a href="/tags/python">Python</a></li><li><a href="/tags/web-scraping">Web scraping</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
