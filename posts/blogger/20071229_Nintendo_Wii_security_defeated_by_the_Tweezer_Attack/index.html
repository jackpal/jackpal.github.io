So the trick was to run their code in GameCube mode, then use the tweezers to short out the address lines to allow the hacker's code to access parts of rest of the memory. By shorting different address lines different portions of memory were made available. By collecting enough shards they eventually mapped all of memory.</p><p>Apparently the Wii operating system keeps its digital signature keys in this protected memory, and once the digital signatures were found it was possible to sign and run homebrew code on the Wii.</p><p>It is not clear to me whether the attack is a per-machine attack or a break-once-run-everywhere attack.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/hacking">Hacking</a></li><li><a href="/tags/wii">Wii</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
