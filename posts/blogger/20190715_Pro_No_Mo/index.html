As far as I can tell, is fine for my current needs.</p><p>I specced out a more powerful and future-proof laptop, a 2019 MacBook Pro with 2x the RAM and SSD storage, but it was 60% more expensive.</p><p>I think it makes more sense for me to buy the cheaper laptop today, and plan on replacing it sooner. Especially because I have a lot of family members who would be fine with the cheaper laptop as a hand-me-down.</p><p>It does feel a little weird to decide that I don't need a "Pro" machine. When it comes down to it, Xcode, a SSD and a retina display are all the "Pro" I need for hobby programming, and Apple has made those features available in the budget Air line.</p><h2>Follow-up</h2><p>In the end I bought the more expensive Macbook Pro. I am a sucker. :-)</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/home-computing">Home computing</a></li><li><a href="/tags/mac">Mac</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
