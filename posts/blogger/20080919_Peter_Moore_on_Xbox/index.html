He's given a very good interview on his time at Sega and Microsoft. (He ran the Xbox game group at Microsoft before moving on to Electronic Arts.) Lots of insight into the Xbox part of the game industry.</p><p>Here he is talking about Rare:</p><pre><code>...and you know, <span class="type">Microsoft</span>, we'd had a tough time getting <span class="type">Rare</span> back –
<span class="type">Perfect Dark Zero</span> was a launch title and didn't <span class="keyword">do as</span> well <span class="keyword">as</span> <span class="type">Perfect Dark</span>…
but we were trying all kinds of classic <span class="type">Rare</span> stuff and unfortunately <span class="type">I</span> think
the industry had passed <span class="type">Rare</span> by – it's a strong statement but what they were
good at, new consumers didn't care about anymore, and it was tough because
they were trying very hard - <span class="type">Chris</span> and <span class="type">Tim Stamper</span> were still there – to <span class="keyword">try</span>
and recreate the glory years of <span class="type">Rare</span>, which <span class="keyword">is</span> the reason <span class="type">Microsoft</span> paid a lot
of money <span class="keyword">for</span> them and <span class="type">I</span> spent a lot of time getting on a train to <span class="type">Twycross</span> to
meet them. <span class="type">Great</span> people. <span class="type">But</span> their skillsets were from a different time and a
different place and were not applicable <span class="keyword">in</span> today's market.
