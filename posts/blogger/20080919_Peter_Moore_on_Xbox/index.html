He's given a very good interview on his time at Sega and Microsoft. (He ran the Xbox game group at Microsoft before moving on to Electronic Arts.) Lots of insight into the Xbox part of the game industry. Here he is talking about Rare:</p><blockquote><p>...and you know, Microsoft, we'd had a tough time getting Rare back –Perfect Dark Zero was a launch title and didn't do as well as Perfect Dark…but we were trying all kinds of classic Rare stuff and unfortunately I thinkthe industry had past Rare by – it's a strong statement but what they weregood at, new consumers didn't care about anymore, and it was tough becausethey were trying very hard - Chris and Tim Stamper were still there – to tryand recreate the glory years of Rare, which is the reason Microsoft paid a lotof money for them and I spent a lot of time getting on a train to Twycross tomeet them. Great people. But their skillsets were from a different time and adifferent place and were not applicable in today's market.</p></blockquote></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/games">games</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
