I wanted to mention that I've ended up not using most of the fancy features.<br><br> <em> The built-in MP3 player had issues with my 1000-song / 100 album / 4 GB music collection: </em> It took a long time to scan the USB storage each time the radio turned on. <em> It was difficult to navigate the album and song lists. </em> Chinese characters were not supported. <em> It took a long time to "continue" a paused item, especially a long item like a podcast. </em> The bluetooth pairing only worked with one phone at a time, which was awkward in a two-driver family.</p><p>Here's how I use it now:</p><ul><li>I connect my phone using both the radio's USB (so the phone is being charged) and mini stereo plugs.<ul><li>I use the phone's built-in music player.</li><li>I have the radio set to AUX to play the music from the stereo input plug.</li></ul></li></ul><p>It's a little bit cluttered, because of the two cables, but it gets the job done. The phone's music player UI is so much better than the radio's UI.</p><p>In effect I have reduced the car stereo to serving as a volume control, an amplifier, and a USB charger.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
