For the past few years I've been using OSX, but recently I've switched over to using Linux.</p><p>Why? Mostly for the higher performance. The full Android system build takes about 30% less time under Ubuntu 8.04 LTS than it does on OSX 10.5 on the same hardware. Not to mention that it's much cheaper to buy a generic PC workstation than the equivalent Mac Pro.</p><p>I have had some early troubles:</p><p>It took me a while to get used to typing the "Ctrl" key instead of the "Command" key, and the ugly Linux fonts bothered me for a few days.</p><p>But since I'm mostly using the exact same programs on Linux as I was on OSX (FireFox, Eclipse, Android), after a few days everything clicked, and I think that I'm just as productive as I was before. And the faster builds and file system stuff (like grep) are wonderful.</p><p>It helped a lot to install the Blubuntu theme and some nice wallpaper to get away from the awful Ubuntu brown/orange color scheme.</p><p>Oh, and I'm using Chromium for Linux, which works pretty well, except that it doesn't support Flash. I still fire up Firefox occasionally to watch Flash videos.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a></li><li><a href="/tags/linux">Linux</a></li><li><a href="/tags/osx">OSX</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
