I saw the Visual Storage exhibit, which is a collection of famous computers, the Babbage Difference Engine, which is a very elaborate reproduction of a never-actually-built Victorian era mechanical calculator, and the PDP-1 demo. This last demo was very special to me, because I finally got to play the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar%21">Spacewar!</a> game, and meet and chat with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell">Steve Russell</a>, the main developer. (Perusing Wikipedia I now realize that Steve was also an early Lisp hacker. D'Oh!, I was going to ask a question about Lisp on the PDP-1, but I got distracted.) There's a <a href="http://spacewar.oversigma.com/">Java Spacewar! emulator</a>, but it doesn't properly convey the look of the PDP-1 radar-scope-based display. The scope displays individual dots, 20,000 times per second. Each dot starts as a fuzzy bright blue-white dot, but then fades quickly to a dim yellow-green spot, which takes another 10 seconds to fade to black. This means that dim yell0w-green trails form behind the ships as they fly around. These trails add a lot to the game's distinctive look. (In addition, due to time multi-plexing, the stars of the starfield are much dimmer than the space ships or the sun.) The fuzzyness of the dots means that the spaceships look much smoother on the PDP-1 scope than they do in the Java simulator. According to Steve Russel and the other doscents, the Java version also runs faster than a real PDP-1. I also got to see serveral other cool PDP-1 hacks, including the original Munching Squares, 4-voice square-wave computer synthezed music, and the famed Minskeytron. The author of the music synth program, <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=theme&s=4&ss=5">Peter Sampson</a>, was present, and explained how he carefully patched into four of the console lights to make a four-voice D/A converter to get music out of the machine. They keep all the hacks loaded into the PDP-1 core at the same time, and just use the front panel to decide which one to jump to. The core memory is non- volitile. The PDP-1 even booted in a few seconds -- just the time it took the power supply to come up to speed. The PDP-1 demo is given twice a month, on the second and fourth Saturdays. I highly recommend it for adults and children over 12. (It's 45 minutes long, so younger kids might get bored.)</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
