After almost a year of use, I’m still pretty happy with the setup. The hardware has worked well. I haven’t done as much independent ML research as I had hoped, but I have contributed many hours of night-time GPU cycles to the <a href="https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero">Leela Zero</a> open-source Go-game-AI project. I don’t think I would change anything about the build, and there’s nothing about it I want to upgrade yet.</p><p>However, in the past year a new option has appeared for on-the-cheap machine learning: Google’s <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb">Colaboratory</a> project. Colaboratory is a free web-based IDE for writing machine learning applications. What’s especially cool about it is that comes with access to a cloud-based GPU. The GPU they provide is the NVIDIA K80, which is not the fastest GPU, but it’s still plenty fast for experimenting with machine learning. [Disclosure: I work for Google, but not in any groups related to Google Colaboratory.]</p><p>Colaboratory puts machine learning within the reach of anyone with a modern web browser, even if that browser is on a device (like a laptop, tablet, or even phone) that doesn’t have a high-end GPU.</p><p>I find myself using Colaboratory instead of my own desktop computer simply because my son’s often using my desktop computer for schoolwork, YouTube and playing games.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/home-computing">Home computing</a></li><li><a href="/tags/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="/tags/collab">Collab</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
