When Andy Rubin heard this, he looked at me, grinned, and said "man, you're on the wrong project!"</p><p>But actually, being late to mobile worked out well. In the early days of Android the daily build was rough. Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream">Sooner and G1</a> prototypes often wouldn't work reliably as phones, and that drove the other Android developers crazy. But since I was not yet relying on a mobile phone, it didn't bother me much.</p><p>Seven years later, [mobile's eaten the world](http://ben- evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/28/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world). But I still haven't internalized what that means. I think I'm still too personal-computer-centric in my thinking and my planning.</p><p>Here's some recent changes that I'm still trying to come to grips with:</p><ul><li>Android and iOS are the important client operating systems. The web is now a legacy system.<ul><li>Containerized Linux is the important server operating system. Everything else is legacy.</li><li>OS X is the important programmer's desktop OS (because it's required for iOS development, and adequate for Android and containerized Linux development.)</li><li>The phone is the most important form factor, with tablet in second place.</li><li>Media has moved from local storage to streaming.</li><li>Programming cultural discussion has moved from blogs &amp; mailing lists to Hacker News, Reddit &amp; Twitter. (To be fair, these new forums mostly link back to blog posts for the actual content.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>In reaction, I've stopped working on the following projects:</p><ul><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&hl=en">Terminal Emulator for Android</a>. When I started this project, all Android devices had hardware keyboards. But those days are long gone. And unfortunately for most people there isn't a compelling use case for an on-the-device terminal emulator. The compelling command-line use cases for mobile are SSH-ing from the mobile device to another machine, and adb-ing into the Android device from a desktop.<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/jackpal/Taipei-Torrent">BitTorrent clients</a>. My clients were written just for fun, to learn how to use the Golang and node.js networking libraries. With the fun/learning task accomplished, and with BitTorrent usage in decline, there isn't much point in working on these clients. (Plus I didn't like dealing with bug reports related to sketchy torrent sites.)</li><li>New languages. For the platforms I'm interested in, the practical languages are C/C++, Java, Objective C, and Swift. (And Golang for server-side work.)<ul><li>I spent much of the past seven years experimenting with dynamic languages, but a year of using Python and JavaScript in production was discouraging. The brevity was great, but the loss of control was not.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Personal Projects for 2015</p><p>First, I'm going to port my ancient game Dandy to mobile. It needs a lot of work to "work" on mobile, but it's a simple enough game that the port should be possible to do on a hobby time budget. I'm probably going to go closed- source on this project, but I may blog the progress, because the process of writing down my thoughts should be helpful.</p><p>After that, we'll see how it goes!</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
