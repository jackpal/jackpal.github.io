He started a blog, called <a href="http://www.futuregpu.org/">Future GPU</a>, where he drops hints and links about Larrabee development. He also tells Microsoft war stories for people in the mood for inside-baseball information about Microsoft's DirectX and game groups. Back when I was working at WebTV and just learning about the 3D graphics world, Phil was nice enough to give me and a few of my WebTV co- workers tickets to the super-desirable GDC DirectX party. These parties were intended for external developers, so it was very hard for non-DirectX Microsofties to attend. Thanks Phil!!! :-) From reading Phil's blog it sounds like <a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GD09/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=9262">Intel's developing a set of graphics debugging tools that they're going to announce at GDC</a>. Could it be PIX-for-Larrabee? I found Phil's site through a "<a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alert</a>" that I set up for Larrabee news. It does a weekly search for Larrabee news. The web's so big and sparsely connected that I'm finding that I've never heard of any of the web sites that the Alert is dredging up. Most of the sites mentioned in the Google Alert are not worth visiting, but a few (like Phil's site) are very interesting indeed.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/larrabee">Larrabee</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
