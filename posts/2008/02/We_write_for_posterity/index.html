(Hi Mom! Hi Friends!) I think it's because right now I don't have much to say that's both unique and interesting. Partly this is because so much of my life is off limits: I don't want to talk about the joys &amp; cares of raising a family, and I musn't talk about the joys &amp; cares of raising a new product. What's left are comments on the general state of the web, and essays on general topics like this one.</p><p>Why write then, and who am I writing for? I write because something inside me compells me to, and because it helps me think to get my ideas down in written form. Who do I write for? From my Analytics numbers it's clear that I'm writing primarily for search engines (Hi Googlebot!) rather than people. And that's something interesting to think about: Baring a world-wide disaster or cultural revoloution, what I write today will persist for thousands and probably even millions of years, and will be read countless times by search engines, and only occasionally, if at all, by people.</p><p>My words will be torn apart and merged with other web pages from other authors, becoming a mulch out of which new insights will be gleaned. (Hmm, not unlike how my body will be recyled when I die, its atoms used to make new things.)</p><p>Perhaps the last time my essay will ever be read by a live human is in some far distant future when some graduate student is writing an essay on early-web-era civilization, and is trying to find out what those poor benighted souls thought of the future. (Hi posterity!)</p><p>No doubt my words will be automatically translated from 21st- century English into whatever language wins the world-wide language wars. Perhaps my essay will even be automatically annotated, with a description of who I was, and a best guess at what I looked like, from searching the world's photo archives. There will be footnotes and links to explain the archaic topics I'm referencing. "Search engine" - they used to store data in seperate computers, and brute-force building the search index. How primitive! How quaint!</p><p>And no doubt the grad-student-of-the-future will glance over my words, then move on to the hundreds of other essays on similar themes. (Good luck with your own essay, future-guy!)</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/introspection">introspection</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
