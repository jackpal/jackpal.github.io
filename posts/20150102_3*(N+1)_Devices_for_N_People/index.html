It was simpler from an account management point of view, and the kids like personalizing their devices with stickers and cases.</p><p>Having assigned devices also makes it easier to give different Internet and gaming privileges to different kids, depending on age and maturity.</p><p>A downside of assigned devices is that not all the devices have the same features. People complain about hand-me-down devices, as well as the perverse incentive created when an accidentally broken device is replaced by a brand new, better device.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
