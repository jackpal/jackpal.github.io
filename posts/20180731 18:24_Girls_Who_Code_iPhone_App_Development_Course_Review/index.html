The first week the girls were taught the basics of the Swift programming language and iPhone App development. The second week the girls formed into 4-person teams and wrote their own iPhone apps.<br><br>The girls learned how to use modern software development tools like Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Trello.<br><br>Much of the instruction during the first week was by way of working through examples from a private Girls Who Code website.<br><br>What worked well:<br><br> <em> The girls learned the basics of iOS app development, especially the Interface Builder. </em> The girls learned how to work in small teams, how to design apps, how to meet deadlines, etc. <em> The girls were motivated by the assignment of writing an app to improve society/the world. </em> The girls learned how to present their final project to a group.</p><p>What could have been better:</p><ul><li>From watching to the final presentations, it seems like all the teams had trouble merging their changes. Every team reported that they had "lost" files and changes.<ul><li>I think an hour spent explaining how to deal with git merges and conflicts, and more tutor hand-holding during merging would be helpful.</li></ul></li><li>The course instructors were not familiar with advanced iOS programming, and could not help teams that wanted to explore more advanced iOS techniques.</li></ul><p>Overall I think this was a well run course, with good value for money. It would be appropriate for a high school girl who was already comfortable programming in Python or Java, and was looking to learn the basics of iOS programming.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
