I have a number of machines, and over the years each one had accumulated several small source- code projects. (Python scripts, toy games, things like that.) I wanted to put these projects under source code control. I also wanted to make sure they were backed-up. Most of these little projects are not ready to be published, so I didn't want to use one of the many web-based systems for source-code management. After some research, I decided to use replicated git repositories. I created a remote git repository on an Internet-facing machine, and then created local git repositories on each of my development machines. Now I can use git push and git pull to keep the repositories synchronized. I use git's built-in ssh transport, so the only thing I had to do on the Internet-facing- machine was make sure that the git executables were in the non-interactive- ssh-shell's path. (Which I did by adding them in my .bashrc file.) Git's ability to work off-line came in handy this Sunday, as I was attending an elementary-school chess tournament with my son. Our local public schools don't have open WiFi, so there was no Internet connectivity. But I was able to happily work away using my local git, and later easily push my changes back to the shared repository.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
