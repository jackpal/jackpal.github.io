I bought the diNovo instead of the Apple Bluetooth keyboard because:</p><ol><li>Built-in trackpad.</li><li>Built in volume control slider.</li><li>Dedicated media transport controls.</li><li>Nifty dock / recharger stand.</li></ol><p>It's my first Bluetooth device. So far I think Bluetooth works a lot better than IR, because you don't have to point it at an IR receiver.</p><p>The diNovo does have some flaws:</p><ul><li>No key backlighting, which makes it hard to use in the dark.</li><li>The mouse buttons below the trackpad are mushy and hinged at the outer edges, making them hard to press. (Happily tapping works and there is a separete left-mouse-button on the left edge of the keyboard. So for typical Mac usage you don't need to use the mushy buttons.)</li><li>A skim of the Logitech support forums indicates that the function keys are not as programmable as some people wish. I don't use function keys that much so this hasn't been an issue for me yet.</li></ul><p>My TV is a 40" LCD, and I sit about 15 feet away from it. At this distance the 1920 x 1280 desktop is just too high resolution for my eyes, so I reduced my screen resolution to 1366 x 720. That seems to work well for now. Apparently I need to get a bigger TV :-)</p><p>Using a keyboard/trackpad instead of a button- based remote control is nice. I like being able to use all the ordinary apps that I already know how to use, rather than have to learn a new set of apps and UI commands. I also like not having to switch input devices depending upon what I'm trying to do. (For example if I want to use a web browser to look up some fact about a video that I just watched, it just works.)</p><p>The diNovo is very smartly designed, so that it's easy to use the mouse while holding the keyboard in two hands. Of course I'm a right hander. A left hander might have a different opinion, as the trackpad is located where it can be used easily with the right hand, but not the left hand.</p><h3>What about Linux?</h3><p>I have been able to use the same keyboard with both Mac and Kubuntu 9.04. With Kubuntu there were some issues around the initial pairing: You need a working keyboard and mouse in order to pair a new Bluetooth device. You even need to reboot once, and answer one final dialog box using a working keyboard / mouse, before the new device pairing is complete.</p><p>A second issue for HTPC use is that the Mac Mini video driver on Kubuntu does not have the flexability to slightly lower the resolution of the screen. I blame Intel for this, as they are in the middle of converting to a new driver model and their current drivers are pretty bare bones.</p><p>One final issue for dual booting Mac systems is that it seems to take a while for the keyboard to reconnect after a restart. This is an issue if you have reFit installed and you're trying to send keystrokes to reFit during the reboot. I found I had to press multiple keys multiple times until reFit started recognizing keys, after which the keyboard acted normally.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/linux">Linux</a></li><li><a href="/tags/mac">Mac</a></li><li><a href="/tags/htpc">htpc</a></li><li><a href="/tags/hardware-review">hardware review</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
