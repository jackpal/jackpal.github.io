I wrote a prototype that let me browse my collection. I was starting to list out all the features I needed to add (zooming, panning, sorting,RAR archive support...). And then I did a web search for comic book reader, spent a couple of minutes reading reviews, and bought one of the popular ones for $2. Sure it's got UI issues, and bugs, and doesn't quite work like it should, but I saved myself weeks of development time.</p><p>I need to think through how best to spend my hacking time in today's world of super abundance. What's my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">comparative advantage</a> in this new world? What's my <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">compliment</a>? What am I trying to learn, trying to achieve? What is worth working on? Existential questions on a Sunday morning. :-)</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/hobby-hacking">Hobby hacking</a></li><li><a href="/tags/iphone">iPhone</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
